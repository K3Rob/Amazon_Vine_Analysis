## Summary:
Based on the results above less than 23% of all of the reviews for video games had 5 star ratings. Of those 0.31 % were from Vine members. With 99.69 % of all 5 star ratings coming from non-Vine sources there appears to be little bias effect on this product category. If someone were inclined they could run a more thourough statistical analysis but that may be overkill with cursory numbers like this. There may be something to be said for exploring how these ratings affect sales numbers and if there's any predictive power to be found. Further data that could be useful is how old the reviews are to see if high early reviews are creating hidden bias.
